//75 APIs are there. I worked on this app, as you can understand apps were of quite medium level and quite a high complexity and not some toy projects... I am publishing this for a few days so that recruiters can 
//get some idea about my previous work. 
//Though at that time codes were not very perfect or overall system design like handling images etc were not proper, but I am putting these so that 
//recruiters at least get some idea about the type of apps I have worked on and overall coding be it Java, scripting language or SQL
